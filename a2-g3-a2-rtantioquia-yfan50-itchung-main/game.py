#   To run the game you will need pygames installed.  See: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/
#   Once you have pygames, you can run the game by using the command:

    """
    undo_move()

    Functionality:
    Reverts the game board and turn counter to their states before the last move was made. It utilizes a history list that stores snapshots of the game state at each move. This function is called when a player wishes to undo their last move.

    How it works:

    Checks if the history list contains any saved states.
    If the history is not empty, it removes (pops) the last saved state from the history list.
    Restores the game board and turn counter to their previous states using the information from the popped history state.
    If an undo operation was successfully performed, the function returns True. Otherwise, if there were no moves to undo (empty history), it returns False.
    Usage:
    This function is typically triggered by a user action, such as pressing an undo button or a specific keyboard key. It should only allow undoing moves when it's a valid operation (e.g., not allowed after the game is over).

    Returns:
    True if the undo operation was successful (i.e., there was a move to undo).
    False if there was no move to undo (i.e., the history list was empty).
